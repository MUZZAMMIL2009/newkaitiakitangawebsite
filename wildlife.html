  <h1>New Zealand's Natives</h1>
  <p>New Zealand is home to a diverse range of wildlife, dominated by birds. However, a lot of these birds are flightless which makes them particularly vulnerable to predators resulting in higher numbers of them and their nests being destroyed. So Project Kaitiaki is trying to protect these unique species, especially the flightless birds, by promoting public conservation efforts and habitat restoration.</p>
<div class="good-animals">
  <h2>Kiwi</h2>
  <img src="C:\Users\muzza\Downloads\kiwi.jpg" alt="Kiwi" width="300" height="200">
  <p>The Kiwi is Aotearoa's most iconic bird. They are a nocturnal and flightless bird who rock unique long beaks with nostrils at the tip along with a baggy brown feather coat to keep warm and camouflage. They possess strong legs and long claws which allow them to run and climb a bit, but are still threatened by predators, we cannot lose our national icon. </p>
  <h2>Kakapo</h2>
  <img src="C:\Users\muzza\Downloads\kakapo.webp" alt="Kea" width="300" height="200">
  <p>The Kakapo is a large, flightless parrot which has been critically endangered. It's numbers stay around 200-300 and it lives only in a few island havens around the South Island. This is the heaviest and the only flightless parrot. Extremely chill and nocturnal for they are needing a close watch to allow their population to recover.</p>
  <h2>Tui</h2>
  <p>Lastly, we have the Tui. The Tui is one of the many New Zealand bird species that DO fly. This bird is unique and charming in it's own right, it has a distinctive white throat taft and a silky emerald-blue feathered body. It primarily feeds on nectar and fruit and lives all over the country. Though it can fly, it's eggs and hatchlings are still in danger.</p>

  <h1>New Zealand Invasives</h1>
  <p>One of the major threats to our native species are introduced predators, especially the mammals that were brought from Europe back in the 1800's. They include species like feral dogs and cats, ferrets, stoats, rats, rabbits, hedgehogs, and mice</p>
<div class="bad-animals">
  <h2>Feral Cats</h2>
  <img src="C:\Users\muzza\Downloads\badcat.jpg" alt="Feral Cat" width="300" height="200">
  <p>Feral cats are a big threat to New Zealand's native birds, as they are vicious hunters who are able to prey on adult birds and also kill their young in their eggs. They were originally house cats brought over by European settlers but they escaped and grew larger and adapted to the wilderness so they became more effective hunters and continue to threaten our native birds.</p>
  <h2>Rats</h2>
  <img src="C:\Users\muzza\Downloads\rat.jpeg" alt="Rat" width="300" height="200">
  <p>Rats are another invasive species that have wrecked havoc despite their small size. It's their size that allows them to hide within trees or shrubs, making them effective hunters of our native birds eggs and hatchlings. Everyone can kill rats even in a busy house, children can participate too. The Take action page explains that.</p>
  <h2>Rabbits</h2>
  <img src="C:\Users\muzza\Downloads\rabbit.jpg" alt="Rabbit" width="300" height="200">
  <p>Rabbits are just as much of an invasive problem as predatory mammals. Though they seem cute and harmless at first, if you think that, you're actually wrong. These rabbits reproduce rapidly and cause significant damage to native plants and change entire landscapes by munching all day which erodes soil and destroys native habitats, further wrecking our native birds. </p>
