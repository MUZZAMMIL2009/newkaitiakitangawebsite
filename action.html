<h1>1. Set up mice and rat traps at home</h1>
<p> Setting up mice and rat traps in your home is a great way for the general population to actually reduce pest numbers. Make sure you buy the right mouse trap and keep it away from small children and pets while keeping it in areas where you think rats might go often. Put a small amount of bait like peanut butter or go buy some general rat bait, but only use inside the house. You are then expecting to kill a couple rats, so then dispose of their bodies appropriately and keep going.</p>
<h1>2. Use Possum Traps in your backyard</h1>
<p>Now Possum traps are a bit more complicated, but still easy to use and a recommended practice for the busy folk. You can purchase one but really make sure it's approved by the Department of Conservation and also you must follow the instructions exactly or consult an expert to make sure you do not harm any native species. Do this with more caution and place them outisde where you think Possums might be lurking in.</p>
<h1>3. Network and Join a local Trapping Group</h1>
<p>Joining a local pest trapping group is a great way to network with other likeminded pest control enthusiats and experts, learn from their experiences, and make this so much more fun. You can even start your own group and get others around you to go seek out some pests and kill them one by one for the sake of our New Zealand birds and Taonga. </p>
<h1>4. Donate to local conservation efforts</h1>
<p>Donating to local conservation efforts and environmental organizations is a great way to help out in fulfilling the mission even if you don't want to practically unalive invasive species. With the money we can invest in better technology and equipment which will allow us to kill more pests more quicker and is overall an amazing way to support this cause. This funds traps, training, restoration, and keeps us going!</p>
<h1>5. Be a responsible pet owner</h1>
<p>If you own a pet, you need to realize that being a responsible pet owner is a crucial part in making sure our native New Zealand bird's bounce back. Keep your pets on a leash and lock your dogs and cats up at night. You can use a bell and/or a bright collar for them to let you know where they are and to also warn birds in the area. Note: UNWANTED ANIMALS SHOULD NEVER BE LEFT IN THE WILD FOR THEY WILL BECOME FERAL. If poisoning possums or rats make sure you follow expert recommendations to keep pets and native birds safe.</p>
<h1>6. Report Sightings</h1>
<p>If you see any invasive threatening species in your area, or on a walk, it is important you report them to local authorities. This can be done by anyone and will allow engaged professionals to hunt them down. More people can do this and we'd be free of pests by 2030 guaranteed. Make sure you report the pests ASAP. </p>
<h1>7. Don't use Poison that harms birds</h1>
<p>When using poison for pest control, it's crucial to choose products that are specifically designed to target the intended invasive species and not our native birds. Always read the label and follow the instructions carefully to minimize the risk of harming non targeted species. Do not use homemade traps unless you're an expert who knows exactly how they work. It is recommended you look for traps and poison approved by the Department of Conservation.</p>
<h1>8. Shoot pests if you're liscenced</h1>
<p>Now if you're a liscenced shooter or hunter, you can actually go out there and shoot a wide range of invasive species, especially the rabbits, ferrets, stoats, and feral cats and dogs. Make sure you have permission in your area and that you follow the guidelines. Consult with other liscenced hunters if unsure on this matter. This is only for the liscneced pros.</p>
<h1>9. Plant Native Trees and Shrubs</h1>
<p>Planting native trees and shrubs is a fantastic way to support local wildlife and regrow the original New Zealand landscape. This will give homes for native birds, insects, lizards, while also helping to restore our ecosystems. This works well especially in the summer. Pohutukawa and Kowhai are great options for you to consider. Plant them anywhere but make sure you have local permission, perhaps push for it.</p>
